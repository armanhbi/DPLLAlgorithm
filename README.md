# DPLLAlgorithm
This program calculates the DPLL Algorithm for you. It is basically a SAT Solver for CNF's. There are three main reasons why I made this program. firstly I wanted to better learn python, secondly I would learn the DPLL algorithm better and thirdly and most importantly I can use it in the exam to gain some time. But I would never do something like this of course! So have fun!
