# DPLLAlgorithm
This program calculates the DPLL Algorithm for you. It is basically a SAT Solver for CNF's.

There are three main reasons why I made this program. First and second reason are that I wanted to better my skills with python and the DPLL algorithm in general.
And third and most important reason is that I can use it in my discrete structures exam to gain some time advantage.
But I would never do something like this of course!
Have fun with this small project!

Time needed: Around 2-3h
